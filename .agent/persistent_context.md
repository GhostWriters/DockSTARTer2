# Project Context

## Repository Locations
- **Go Version (current)**: [DockSTARTer2](file:///c:/Users/CLHat/Documents/GitHub/GhostWriters/DockSTARTer2)
- **Bash Version (legacy)**: [DockSTARTer](file:///c:/Users/CLHat/Documents/GitHub/GhostWriters/DockSTARTer)

## Parity Goals


- Replicate Bash behavior exactly in Go.
- High emphasis on identical logging and file handling.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity where Bash used simpler methods (e.g., direct timestamp comparisons).
